## EE

This EE got a grade C. I didn't see the feedback obviously, but I think I probably shot myself in the foot with this topic. 4000 words were definitely not enough to thoroughly explain and do the topic justice, and also the examiners might have been expecting some kind of experimentation rather than just theory and analysis (since IB CS is considered a G4 subject). Either ways, don't choose a similar topic lol.

### Topic
Programming langauge design / Type systems

### RQ
To what extent is type inference possible for statically typed polymorphic object-oriented programming languages?

### Other ideas
These are some topics I considered/was interested in when looking for my EE topic (and some resources/links to related stuff).

- Type systems / Type inference
  - Specifically, Hindley-Milner: [HM Wikipedia page][1]
  - [A simple type inference algorithm in python][2]
  - [A Haskell implementation of Algorithm W][3]

- Dynamic Programming

- Natural Language Processing
  - Specifically, using Markov models for NLP.

- Investigating HashMap implementations
  - For example, playing around with load factors and hashing algorithms and investigating their effects on, for example, speed.

- Distributed fault-tolerant systems and concurrent programming
  - Specifically, a sort of case study into thedesign and implementation of the BEAM VM and the Elixir/Erlang ecosystem.
  - [Paper on reliable distributed systems][4]
  - [History of the BEAM compiler][5]
  - [Concurrency with BEAM & Elixir][6]
  - [Paper on algorithm for a concurrent FIFO queue][7]
  - [This paper on the Reduceron, a processor optimized specifically for parallelism and functional programming][8]
