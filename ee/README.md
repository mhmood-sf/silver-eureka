## EE

### Topic
Programming langauge design / Type systems

### RQ
To what extent is type inference possible for statically typed polymorphic object-oriented programming languages?

### Other ideas
These are some topics I considered/was interested in when looking for my EE topic.

- Type systems / Type inference
  - Specifically, Hindley-Milner: [HM Wikipedia page](1)
  - [A simple type inference algorithm in python](2)
  - [A Haskell implementation of Algorithm W](3)

- Dynamic Programming

- Natural Language Processing
  - Specifically, using Markov models for NLP.

- Investigating HashMap implementations
  - For example, playing around with load factors and hashing algorithms and investigating their effects.

- Distributed fault-tolerant systems and concurrent programming
  - Specifically, a sort of case study into thedesign and implementation of the BEAM VM and the Elixir/Erlang ecosystem.
  - [Paper on reliable distributed systems](4)
  - [History of the BEAM compiler](5)
  - [Concurrency with BEAM & Elixir](6)
  - [Paper on algorithm for a concurrent FIFO queue](7)
  - [This paper on the Reduceron, a processor optimized specifically for parallelism and functional programming](8)
