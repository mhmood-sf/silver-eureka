### Topic
Using mathematical and statistical analysis to assess the efficiency of computer algorithms

### Outline
**Mathematical Analysis:**<br>
Algorithmic analysis

**Statistical Analysis:**<br>
Implement the algorithms (in C because it's low-level) and collect data for the running time with different input sizes (multiple trials, of course). Perform statistical analysis on data (might need to look up Spearman's Rank instead of PCC). Find best-fit equations for each, and compare those to the ones found from mathematical analysis.

**Algorithms:**<br>
Probably bubble sort and insertion sort:
- Both perform the same task (sorting a list)
- Same best case (Ω(n)), same average case (Θ(n^2)) and same worst case (O(n^2))
- Same time complexity (O(1))
